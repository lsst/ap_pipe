# This is a prescription for quantum clustering with BPS, suitable for any
# concrete pipeline based on the AP template pipeline that include SkyCorr
# such as when running on HSC data.
#
# Use it by adding:
#
#   includeConfigs:
#     - ${AP_PIPE_DIR}/bps/clustering/clustering_HSC_ApTemplate.yaml
#
# (with no outer indentation) to your BPS config file.
