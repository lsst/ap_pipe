# This is a prescription for quantum clustering with BPS, suitable for any
# concrete pipeline based on the AP pipeline. Note that there are separate
# example files for pipelines with and without fakes. 
#
# Use it by adding:
#
#   includeConfigs:
#     - ${AP_PIPE_DIR}/bps/clustering/clustering_ApPipe.yaml
#
# (with no outer indentation) to your BPS config file. If you are running
# fakes, use instead:
#
#   includeConfigs:
#     - ${AP_PIPE_DIR}/bps/clustering/clustering_ApPipeWithFakes.yaml
#
# again with no outer indentation.
