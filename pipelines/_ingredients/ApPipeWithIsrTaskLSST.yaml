description: End to end Alert Production pipeline with IsrTaskLSST.

# Per RFC-997, all variants of ApPipe must define three mutually exclusive subsets:
# - preload is tasks that can be run before raw images arrive
# - prompt is everything done by Prompt Processing starting from raws
# - afterburner is metrics and other non-essential tasks that are skipped by Prompt Processing

imports:
  - $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/_ingredients/ApPipe.yaml

tasks:
  isr:
    class: lsst.ip.isr.IsrTaskLSST
    config:
      # Some instruments have this already in obs_lsst.
      # Here we turn if off for AP generally.
