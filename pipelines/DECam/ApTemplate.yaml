description: The AP template building pipeline specialized for DECam
# This pipeline assumes the working repo has raws, calibs, refcats, and a skymap,
# and that you have already run the RunIsrForCrosstalkSources.yaml pipeline.

instrument: lsst.obs.decam.DarkEnergyCamera
imports:
  - location: $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/DECam/ProcessCcd.yaml
  - location: $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/_ingredients/ApTemplate.yaml

      - processCcd

subsets:
# The singleFrameAp subset is identical to the one in
# $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/_ingredients/ApTemplate.yaml, but needs to be defined
# here because isr, characterizeImage, and calibrate are coming from the
# DECam-specific ProcessCcd pipeline.
