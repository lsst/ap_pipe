# (0) Ensure median calibration products and template coadds exist for the data being processed
# (1) Run $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/DECam/RunIsrForCrosstalkSources.yaml
# (2) Execute `apdb-cli create-sql`, e.g.,
#     apdb-cli create-sql "sqlite:////project/user/association.db" apdb_config.py
# (3) Run this pipeline, setting appropriate diaPipe configs
#     (diaPipe configs must match the apdb-cli parameters)
