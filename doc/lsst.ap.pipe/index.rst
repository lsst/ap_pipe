.. Paragraph that describes what this Python module does and links to related modules and frameworks.

The ``lsst.ap.pipe`` module links together a set of common image processing tasks so that a user may run one command on a dataset of raw, ingested images rather than several.
The Alert Production (AP) pipeline includes the following key data processing Tasks for LSST Prompt Data Products: `~lsst.ip.isr.IsrTask`, `~lsst.pipe.tasks.characterizeImage.CharacterizeImageTask`, `~lsst.pipe.tasks.calibrate.CalibrateTask`, `~lsst.pipe.tasks.imageDifference.ImageDifferenceTask`, and `~lsst.ap.association.DiaPipelineTask`.

At present, the alert production pipeline is implemented using two separate frameworks that store and retrieve data from "Butler" repositories in incompatible ways:

- `ApPipeTask` is an `lsst.pipe.base.CmdLineTask` that reads and writes data using the :ref:`lsst.daf.persistence` package.
  This is the established "Gen 2" framework.
- ``ApPipe`` is an `lsst.pipe.base.Pipeline` that reads and writes data using the :ref:`lsst.daf.butler` package.
  This "Gen 3" framework is expected to be the only implementation in the future.

.. TODO: add links to Gen 3 docs as they become available
